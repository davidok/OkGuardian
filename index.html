					After all these years, I still have some kind of sick fascination with heroin
					<div class="wholeQuote">
						Heroin is a very potent drug. The high feels like a long lasting orgasm. Recovery from heroin addiction is almost a miracle. Because it is not only your body that screams for the substance. Your brain wants it too. Without heroin, emotional pain feels unbearable.

					When I first gave up heroin, I could never tell myself it was forever
					<div class="wholeQuote">
						I woke up last week to the radio playing quietly. I got ready for the trek to the other end of the house to wake up the kid. The 7:30am news came on. I was still sleepy. "The actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman is dead." I was only half listening. I'd seen his work but have never been one to pay much attention to famous personalities or celebrities. "He was forty-six." That caught half my attention – the same age as me. "From a heroin overdose." There I was, sitting on the edge of my bed with a syringe full of heroin in my hand.<br><br>
						All at once I felt a kindred with someone I had never known. I knew a couple of characters he'd played, I knew his name, but that was it. Now suddenly, he was a lot like me.<br><br>
						When you're addicted to heroin, it's generally a long-running, close relationship. There are plenty of bad times, but there are also gems that stay with you. It's like family – a parent, sibling or child. You may swear that for all they've put you through, you never want anything to do with them again, but there's always that part of you that misses the good times and wonders how you'd get along now. When I first gave up heroin, I could never tell myself it was forever. I could not imagine never entering that cosy cocoon again.
